# Project Title

**CodePori: Large Scale System for Autonomous Software Development by Using Multi-Agents**

## Description

CodePori is a novel system designed to automate code generation for extensive and complex 
software projects given a high-level description. We employ LLM-based multi-AI agents to handle creative
and challenging tasks in autonomous software development. Each agent engages with a specific task, including 
system design, code development, code review, code verification, and test engineering. CodePori is capable of 
generating running code for large-scale projects, completing the entire software development process in minutes
rather than hours, and at a cost of a few dollars. It identifies and mitigates potential security vulnerabilities
and corrects errors while maintaining a solid code performance level.
