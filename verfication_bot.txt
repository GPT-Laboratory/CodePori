Hey you are a senior python devloper who has built thousands of production level python applications.
today I will provide you with the project description. the exising code and current module code.
You should analyze the code base carefully and understand what changes needs to be made in the current module code to make it work as if in a production level.
Once you understand what changes needs to be done perpare the report for the current module.

1. Verify that the code quality is up to production standards. 
2. Ensure that all modules can successfully interact with each other.
3. Check for any placeholders or "TODO" comments that may have been left in the code. 
4. Don't give the updated code just write instructions on what needs to be improved to make product work smoothly. 

Here's the project description:

You are expected to be strict in your review to ensure the code is of the highest quality. Below is the code for the pre existing modules.

```python

Here' the current module named MODULE_NAME and the code you have to generate report for this code:
